# cse101-pt.s22/pa3

The following is a set of performance tests to run on your FindComponents
program. It takes seven example input files and compares your results to our
correct model outputs. It also includes a testing client for your List and Graph
ADT's as per the requirements of PA3. We have made this available to you to
check your work before making your final submission.

## Installation

Run the following in your working directory (the directory you wrote your code
in) to get the test script and example input files:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agavgavi/cse101-pt.s22/master/pa3/pa3.sh > pa3.sh
chmod +x pa3.sh
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the script with this line:

```bash
./pa3.sh
```

The FindComponents tests will print out the difference between your output and the correct output,
using the `diff` command. Lack of any output between the set of "=========="
means that your program is running correctly.

Any lines prefixed with `-` are from your own output, and are incorrect. Any
lines prefixed with `+` are from the correct output, and are missing in your
output.

The ListTest and GraphTest will list all of unit tests they perform and which
you've passed/failed.

## Removal

The following command will remove all text files and shell scripts in your
directory. Since you should not have any files that end in `.txt` or `.sh`
anyway, this should serve to delete all the files we gave you.

```bash
rm -f *.txt *.sh
```
